## Table syntax in LaTeX is complicated

Inserting(Generating ) Table in LaTeX is a headache.(At least for me). This is due to the complex LaTeX Table syntax,for instance, unlimited `&` for column alignment,that is not to mention alignment inside column above it.

## Solution 1

[Tables generator for LaTeX, html, markdown](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#)

Basically the same way with Excel and the code will automatically generated.

-   Pro

    1.  For a small datasets,
    2.  Input and formatting is very straightforward and intuitive.

-   Cons

    1.  You can not do any calculation beyond the the text itself.
    2.  It is incapable of processing large datasets.
    3.  Risk of errors arising from typos.

## Solution 2

R is language that is designed for statistics. And R has some many great packages `gt`, `gtsummary`, `gtExtra` `kable`, `kableExtra` ...

The only thing you need to care about is the data manipulation itself, with a fw lines of code the Table is automatically generated and formatted based on your syntax.

**So it will be great if one can adopt the Table directed from R to LaTeX**

Here I introduce a method was written in the `kableExtra` file called [Create Awesome LaTeX Table with knitr::kable and kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf)

The solution is put "latex" in the R code, then the output will be converted into LaTeX code with the data inside and one can directly copy and paste into LaTeX IDE.

Example: `kbl(data,"latex",  booktabs = T)`

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
require(kableExtra)
require(tidyverse)
# get partial data from mtcars for making a table
dt <- mtcars[1:5,1:6]
dt%>%
  kbl(caption = "Recreating booktabs style table") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

From R code to LaTeX code is

``` r
dt%>%
  kbl("latex",caption = "Recreating booktabs style table") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

The LaTeX code is

``` tex
\begin{table}

\caption{Recreating booktabs style table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|r|r|r|r|r}
\hline
  & mpg & cyl & disp & hp & drat & wt\\
\hline
Mazda RX4 & 21.0 & 6 & 160 & 110 & 3.90 & 2.620\\
\hline
Mazda RX4 Wag & 21.0 & 6 & 160 & 110 & 3.90 & 2.875\\
\hline
Datsun 710 & 22.8 & 4 & 108 & 93 & 3.85 & 2.320\\
\hline
Hornet 4 Drive & 21.4 & 6 & 258 & 110 & 3.08 & 3.215\\
\hline
Hornet Sportabout & 18.7 & 8 & 360 & 175 & 3.15 & 3.440\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

More complex tables may use package in TeX system

    -  \usepackage{booktabs}
    -  \usepackage{longtable}
    -  \usepackage{array}
    -  \usepackage{multirow}
    -  \usepackage{wrapfig}
    -  \usepackage{float}
    -  \usepackage{colortbl}
    -  \usepackage{pdflscape}
    -  \usepackage{tabu}
    -  \usepackage{threeparttable}
    -  \usepackage{threeparttablex}
    -  \usepackage[normalem]{ulem}
    -  \usepackage{makecell}
    -  \usepackage{xcolor}

## Solution 3

**Why Not use Rmarkdown/Quarto directly for an article or a Report** <br>
It is pdf friendly.<br> Easily deal with in column plot which is still very diffcult for TeX system.
