## Basic Process

**FP_best_for_genernal_use** -\> **Genreal_Priciple**-\> **Trial_and_Error**

## Genreal Priciple

1.  Express efficiently and without toxicity

2.  Sufficient photostability (stable \~ duration in the experiment)

3.  Fluoresecent proteins(FP) is to be expressed as a fusion protein, FP should not oligomerize(形成低聚物)

4.  FP should be insensitive to environmental effects.

5.  FP once being used in multiple-plex experiments should have minimal crosstalk in excitation and emission.

6.  FRET or selective optical labeling using photocon-vertible FPs.

## Brightness and Expression

-   FP vendors is skeptical (claimed brightness may not be real)
-   Oxygen presence is needed for FPs expressed in living organisms
-   Temperature 25 ^0^C or 37 ^0^C (some FPs Temp influenced the expression)
-   Chaperones(配体) (In bacteria and mammalian cells may differ )
