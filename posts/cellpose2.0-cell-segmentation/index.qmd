Cell segmentation is the process of identifying and isolating individual cells in an image or volume. It is a fundamental step in many image analysis pipelines, particularly in the fields of microscopy and cellular imaging.

There are various methods for cell segmentation, including manual segmentation, thresholding, and machine learning algorithms. Manual segmentation involves manually drawing contours around cells in an image using a software tool. Thresholding involves setting a pixel intensity threshold and separating the image into foreground (cell) and background (non-cell) pixels based on whether the pixel intensities are above or below the threshold. Machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning neural networks, can be trained to recognize cells in images and automatically segment them.

Cell segmentation is used in many applications, including cell counting, cell tracking, and cell classification. It can be useful in a wide range of research areas, including cell biology, cancer research, and drug discovery.
