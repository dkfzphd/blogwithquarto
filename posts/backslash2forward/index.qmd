In R, you can use the gsub function to replace the backslashes in a string with forward slashes. Here is an example of how you can use gsub:

```{r}
x <- "C:\\Users\\MyName\\Documents\\file.txt"

x_new <- gsub("\\\\", "/", x)

x
x_new
```

This will replace all the backslashes in the string x with forward slashes. The result will be stored in a new string x, which will contain the modified version of the original string.

Alternatively, you can use the sub function to replace only the first occurrence of a backslash in the string. Here is an example of how you can use sub:

```{r}
x <- "C:\\Users\\MyName\\Documents\\file.txt"
x <- sub("\\\\", "/", x, fixed = TRUE)
```

This will replace only the first backslash in the string x with a forward slash. The fixed = TRUE argument tells sub to treat the pattern as a string, rather than a regular expression.

**But I recommended Notepad++**
