\noindent This is our second document. It contains a title and a 
section with text.Following the latest data, around 3 million tourists visit London every year. The capital city of England and the United Kingdom attracts a lot of visitors, especially Americans. This is probably due to the position it holds in the world economy.
Not by chance London has been defined by some of the most important sociologists of the XX century as a global city. That’s how people and cultures blend together continuously, creating a multicultural place, where $\frac{1}{3}$  of the population is foreign-born. Being a language student, I was impressed when I discovered that over 200 different idioms are spoken in London.
In my travel itineraries I usually try to focus on some unusual places to visit, because I find them more fascinating than visiting the typical monuments or museums, those which everybody already knows. Thus, here you are my top 5 sites in London:\\
